# BerserkParser
Dirty script written to parse TikTok JSON files.

## Origin

I wrote BerserkParser after publishing two [articles](https://medium.com/@BTF117/tiktok-osint-targeted-user-investigation-9e206f8bb794) on TikTok OSINT and the information that was available if you intercept JSON sessions with a proxy.

When I saw how dirty and nuts this code looked like, it was clear that berserk was the right name for it! By the way: this is my first real Python stuff...that should explain a lot.

## Usage

First, you need a set of JSON files. To collect those, you can use [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or the proxy of your choice.

To configure Fiddler and your device, use this post on [Telerik website](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/how-to-capture-android-traffic-with-fiddler).

Then, to filter the right files, I suggest you head to the **Filters** and:

1. Tick **"Show only if URL contains"** and add _/aweme/v1/_
2. Choose **Show only JSON** in the _Response Type and Size_ zone
3. Get your device/emulator, launch **TikTok**
4. Search for the profile you want to investigate and **before** actually seeing it, _Remove all_ the sessions in Fiddler
5. Hit the target profile and **scroll the videos, the profile, the followers and the followings**
6. You are done with the app, **get back to Fiddler**
7. Go to _File->Export Sessions->All Sessions->Raw Files_ and hit _Next_
8. Choose an easy to remember PATH, copy it and click _Export >>_

Then you can run the Python script of your choice. You can either have the output written to the screen (_BerserkParser\_to\_screen.py_) or to a file (_BerserkParser\_to\_file.py_). 
There are many problems in the JSON files that require formatting and flattening. The end result may even be not correctly shown when emojis and other icons are used.

```
python3 .\BerserkParser_to_file.py
```

or

```
python3 .\BerserkParser_to_screen.py
```


Paste the directory path you copied before (or type it) and hit enter. The script will run for a few seconds.
